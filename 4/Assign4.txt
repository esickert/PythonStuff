 1)Write a method capitalizePlurals that accepts an ArrayList of strings and replaces every word ending with an "s" with its uppercased version.
     Write a method removePlurals that accepts an ArrayList of strings and removes every word in the list ending with an "s", case-insensitively

2)  Write a program that reads in 10 temperature values (as doubles) for 10 days of weather, computes the average temperature, and displays the number of days that were hotter than  the average. 


3)Find the maximum value of an array
4)Find the minimum value of an array
5)Average value of an array
6)Reverse the elements within an array

7)Examine a number and count the number of occurances of every digit.
	ex.   the number 229231007 contains 
			2    zero's
			1 one
			3 two's
			1 seven
			1 nine

8) Write a method reverse that reverses the order of the elements in an ArrayList of strings.

9) Write a method capitalizePlurals that accepts an ArrayList of strings and replaces every word ending with an "s" with its uppercased version.  DONE

10) Write a method removePlurals that accepts an ArrayList of strings and removes every word in the list ending with an "s", case-insensitively.  DONE

11) Write a method addStars that accepts an array list of strings as a parameter and places a * after each element.

	Example: if an array list named list initially stores:
	[the, quick, brown, fox]

	Then the call of addStars(list);  makes it store:
	[the, *, quick, *, brown, *, fox, *]


12) Write a method removeStars that accepts an array list of strings, assuming that every other element is a *, and removes the stars (undoing what was done by addStars above).

13) Write a method intersect that accepts two sorted array lists of integers as parameters and returns a new list that contains only the elements that are found in both lists.


	Example: if lists named list1 and list2 initially store:
	[1, 4, 8, 9, 11, 15, 17, 28, 41, 59]
	[4, 7, 11, 17, 19, 20, 23, 28, 37, 59, 81]

	Then the call of intersect(list1, list2)  returns the list:
	[4, 11, 17, 28, 59]
